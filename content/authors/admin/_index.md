bio: My research interests include numerical cognition, mathematical development, and education. Specifically, I am studying **connections between fractions and algebra knowledge** and the ways that **visual representations** influence math learners' strategies and thinking. My dissertation aims to bridge methods and frameworks from psychology and mathematics education. Motivated by my research in cognitive science, I am also passionate about **teaching and mentoring practices**. I have experience as an instructor for both online and in-person Child and Adolescent Development classes, as a TA for a large introductory psychology class, and as an instructor for a summer statistics workshop series for undergraduates.
