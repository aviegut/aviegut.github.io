abstract: "In this talk, I (a) discuss the implications of the broader symposium’s talks for building a big-picture model of the fractions-algebra relation and (b) suggest new research directions by bringing in perspectives from math education research. Separately, math education researchers (e.g., Hackenberg, 2013) and psychologists (e.g., Siegler et al., 2012) have shown that fractions knowledge is important for algebra competence. However,this work has been largely disconnected. In this talk, I discuss 2 ways in which future psychological research can integrate insights from math education research. First, research can more comprehensively measure which aspects of fractions knowledge support which aspects of algebra. For instance, in this symposium, Booth et al. and Gesuelli et al. show evidence that fraction arithmetic is particularly important for algebra learning, whereas Jay et al. suggest that fraction equivalence may be key. Other work suggests that iterating and partitioningis uniquely important (e.g., Hackenberg, 2013), but this part of fractions knowledge is not often measured by psychologists. Finally, research can consider whether the fractions-algebra relation is causal or constitutive. Indeed, Jay et al. suggest that instruction can highlight the algebraic character of fractions, and some math education researchers suggest that fractions and algebra converge in that they are both extensions of multiplicative thinking. I end with a suggestion that interdisciplinary investigation will better inform developmental theory and educational practice."
