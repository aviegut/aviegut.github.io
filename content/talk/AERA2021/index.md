abstract: "The current study examines the gestures that students produce when explaining their strategies to solve fraction comparison problems. While being recorded, undergraduates (N=52) compared pairs of symbolic and nonsymbolic fractions (10 items each; see Figure 1) and described to an experimenter their strategies for determining the larger fraction. Based on prior eye-tracking evidence (e.g., Obersteiner & Tumpek, 2016), we hypothesized that students would engage in horizontal gestures (e.g., gesturing between the two numerators) when using componential strategies and vertical gestures (i.e., gesturing within a single fraction) when using holistic strategies. We also hypothesized that nonsymbolic representations may be less susceptible to whole number bias and thus elicit more holistic strategies (i.e., vertical gestures). Finally, we hypothesized that fractions with common components (e.g., 19/98 vs. 11/98) would elicit more componential strategies and horizontal gestures than fractions without common components (e.g., 14/97 vs. 13/43). Our results were closely aligned with our hypotheses. We found that students’ gestures are related to the strategies they use on a fraction comparison task and that their gestures reliably relate to the fraction representations they are given.These gesture patterns are consistent with the eye-tracking patterns found in symbolic fraction comparison tasks, and these findings are informing new research to experimentally test whether the gesture observed in these undergraduates can serve as an instructional tool for teachers to use to support successful strategy use in younger age groups."

summary: People often use component-based strategies when thinking about fraction sizes (e.g., 3/7 is bigger than 1/4 because 3 > 1 and 7 > 4). We examined undergraduates' gestures and strategies as they explaining their strategies for choosing which of two fractions were bigger. We found that students’ gestures were closely related to their strategies. We also found that visual representations of fractions elicited fewer error-prone component-based strategies and gestures.
